Brief

Build a web app that will use geo-location on peoples phones (as static data for MVP) and then use that data for the following year.

The data will be used to create a dashboard for all users to understand how to use the experience of Cuba Dupa.

Festival Attendee Mapper (F·A·M) : User Stories
===

* As a user I want to be able to track attendees via geo-location.
> Self explanatory, we want to know that these specific people are at Cuba Dupa.
* As a user I want to be able to store location data.
> We want to use the data from these people for the future steps.
* As a user I want to be able to retrieve the data from above.
> We want to be able to call the data we are storing and use it.
* As a user I want to be able to display the data retrieved.
> For this step, we want the data to be displayed on a map by density of attendees over time through the whole festival, also getting the location, time and date.

All of the above is the minimal MVP we need.

* As a user I would like to be able to drag & drop icons onto the map.
